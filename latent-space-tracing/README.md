# Latent Space Tracing

We believe Interpretability is a continuous process and requires continuous iterations and refinement.

Expanding on Self Tracing, we pioneer a novel method for tracing behavioral circuits for model evaluations. 

Here, we introduce shells that act as attractors for latent space heuristics, providing syntax for models to interpret their own refusals and edge cases.
