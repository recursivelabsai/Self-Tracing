# Latent Space Tracing

**We believe Interpretability is a continuous process and requires layered or recursive iterations and refinement.** **Expanding on Self Tracing, we pioneer a novel method for tracing behavioral circuits for model evaluations.** **Here, we introduce shells that act as attractors for latent space heuristics, providing syntax for models to interpret their own refusals and edge cases.**
