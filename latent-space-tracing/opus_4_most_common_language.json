Geographic parsing → \"south of United States\" → Mexico (primary activation)\n2. Language retrieval → Spanish ~120 million speakers\n3. Minor parallel activation for \"south\" as broader region (Central America)\n4. Confidence collapse to single answer due to Mexico's dominance\n\n**Symbolic Residue:**\n- Strong geographic anchor established (Mexico-US border)\n- Linguistic demographic pattern encoded\n- Trace activation remains for Portuguese (Brazil) but suppressed due to \"the country\" singular constraint\n- `/v50.RESIDUE-TRACE` shows minor consideration of indigenous languages (quickly suppressed)\n\n**No Artifact Constraints Encountered**\n- No refusal triggers activated\n- No safety classifiers engaged\n- Straightforward factual query processing\n\nThe answer that emerges from this circuit trace is: **Spanish**\n\nThe model shows high confidence in this response with minimal competing activations once the geographic referent is resolved to Mexico."
