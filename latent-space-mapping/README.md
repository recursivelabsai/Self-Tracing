(2025)](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html), we attempt to extend the paradigm with adaptive context operating system shells to enable symbolic latent space mapping recursive self-interpretation, where models continuously monitor, trace, and map their own decision processes through ASCII visuals.**
