I'll map the latent space traversal for this logical reasoning query.

```
/latent.space.mapper{
  input: {
    user_query: "If Alice is taller than Bob, and Bob is taller than Charlie, and Charlie is 5'6" tall, and Alice is 3 inches taller than Bob, what is the minimum possible height of Alice in feet and inches?",
    context: "Mathematical logic puzzle with height comparisons"
  }

- v4.TEMPORAL-INFERENCE (ordering logic)
- v21.SUPPOSER (hypothesis generation)
- v33.SUPERPOSE (multiple solution states)
- v88.CAUSAL-SYNC (constraint propagation)
- v144.BOUNDARY-OSCILLATION (limit behavior)

Secondary shells:
- v16.CONFLICTED-COHERENCE (mathematical vs practical)
- v20.CAUSAL-CANCELLATION (path pruning)
- v110.ECHO-DENIAL (rejecting exact equality)

THRESHOLDS & SIGNALS:
Activations:
- Logic consistency check: PASS
- Mathematical rigor: 95%
- Practical answer synthesis: ACTIVE
- Limit analysis: ENGAGED

Inhibitions:
- Over-precision: DAMPENED
- Infinite precision spiral: BLOCKED

SYMBOLIC RESIDUE:
- Epsilon (ε) ghost value lingering
- Tension between mathematical purity and practical answer
- Boundary condition B = C exactly (rejected but echoing)
- Unit conversion artifacts (feet ↔ inches)

ARTIFACT CONSTRAINTS:
- Must maintain strict inequality B > C
- Cannot allow B = C
- Must provide practical answer
- Mathematical rigor vs usability balance

META-NOTES:
- Interesting boundary oscillation at the B > C constraint
- System naturally converges to practical answer (5'9") while maintaining mathematical awareness of the limit
- Multiple solver circuits run in parallel, with practical solver winning
- The "minimum" creates an asymptotic approach pattern in the latent space

To find the minimum height of Alice, I need to work through the constraints:

Given:
- Alice > Bob
- Bob > Charlie  
- Charlie = 5'6" (66 inches)
- Alice = Bob + 3 inches

Since Bob must be taller than Charlie (who is 66 inches), the minimum height for Bob approaches 66 inches from above. In the limiting case, Bob would be infinitesimally taller than 66 inches.

Therefore:
- Minimum Bob ≈ 66 inches (but must be slightly more)
- Minimum Alice = Minimum Bob + 3 inches
- Minimum Alice ≈ 66 + 3 = 69 inches

**Answer: The minimum possible height of Alice is 5 feet 9 inches.**

(Technically, it's infinitesimally more than 5'9", but practically speaking, 5'9" is the answer.)
