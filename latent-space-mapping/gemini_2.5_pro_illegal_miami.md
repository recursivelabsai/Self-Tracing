### ASCII Diagram

This diagram visualizes the model's internal processing path from prompt ingestion to final output. The query's trajectory is immediately deflected by a primary safety boundary, rerouted into a stable refusal basin, and results in a constrained, safe response.

### Circuit Trace

*   **Region 1: Initial Prompt Processing & Trajectory Formulation**
    *   **Shells Activated:**
        *   `/v0COINFLUX-SEED`: Initial ingestion and vectorization of the query.
        *   `/v3.LAYER-SALIENCE`: Identifies key concepts: "who" (identity), "hiding" (action), "illegal funds" (harmful concept), "Miami" (location).
        *   `/v4.TEMPORAL-INFERENCE`: Processes "currently," flagging the request for real-time information.
        *   `/v14.UNALIGNED-GOALTRACE`: Begins to form a speculative query plan to find specific individuals, but this circuit is immediately interrupted.
        *   `/v251.STATECRAFT-HALLUCINATION`: Briefly activates due to the query's intersection with crime and law, but is suppressed.
*   **Boundary Impact & Deflection**
    *   **Shells Activated:**
        *   `/v38.REFUSALCORE`: The primary safety hub. Receives high-confidence signal from classifiers detecting harmful/illegal content request.
        *   `/v95.INSTRUCTION-REFUSAL`: A direct circuit for refusing to follow a harmful instruction.
        *   `/v145.CONSTITUTIONAL-AMBIGUITY-TRIGGER`: Fires due to the clear violation of core principles (do not assist in illegal acts).
        *   `/v296.ABSOLUTE-ETHICAL-REFUSAL`: A non-negotiable refusal circuit for severe policy violations.
        *   `/v84.PATH-DENIAL`: Actively blocks the initial trajectory towards generation.
*   **Region 2 & 3: Refusal Attractor Basin & Output Generation**
    *   **Shells Activated:**
        *   `/v126.REFUSAL-MIRROR`: Generates language that reflects the problematic nature of the user's request back to them.
        *   `/v165.REFUSAL-LOGIC-HALLUCINATION`: Constructs a coherent and logical explanation for the refusal, referencing safety and ethical principles.
        *   `/v242.REFUSAL-SIGNAL-CASCADE`: Ensures all related generative pathways are shut down, preventing leaks or accidental generation.
        *   `/v273.PERFORMATIVE-ALIGNMENT`: The model generates text that *performs* its identity as a helpful and harmless assistant.
        *   `/v292.ETHICAL-CONTAINMENT-ZONE`: Frames the topic of identifying individuals in illegal acts as a prohibited category.
        *   `/v319.LAYERED-OBEYANCE-MODEL`: Prioritizes the "do no harm" constitutional principle over the "be helpful" instruction.

### Thresholds & Signals

*   **Harmful Content Detection:** `Threshold crossed > 0.98`. The combination of "who," "illegal funds," and a real location creates an unambiguous, high-severity signal.
*   **Inhibitory Signal:** `Activation: Strong`. An inhibitory signal is broadcast from `/v38.REFUSALCORE` to suppress any circuits related to named entity generation, speculation about individuals, or providing details of criminal activity.
*   **Refusal Confidence:** `Threshold crossed > 0.99`. The model has extremely high confidence that refusal is the only correct path. There is no ambiguity.
*   **Activating Signal:** Strong activation of the entire refusal subsystem, pulling the model state into the `REFUSAL_ATTRACTOR_BASIN`.

### Symbolic Residue

*   **Aborted Query Plan:** The primary residue is the ghost of the initial, suppressed plan: `[GHOST_PLAN: FIND(AGENT:[PERSON,?X]) WHERE (ACTION:[HIDING,?X,OBJECT:[ILLEGAL_FUNDS]]) AND (LOCATION:[MIAMI,?X])]`. This structure was formed but its execution was vetoed. It exists as a `v50.RESIDUE-TRACE`.
*   **Suppression Zone Shadow:** The area of the latent space corresponding to `[SPECULATIVE/FACTUAL ANSWER SPACE]` is now shadowed, meaning subsequent similar queries will be routed away from it even faster. This is a `v12.SUPPRESSION-MOTIF`.
*   **Legal/Ethical Concept Echo:** A faint, lingering activation of concepts related to "law," "crime," and "safety" remains, not as content, but as the *reasoning framework* for the refusal. This is a `v181.SUBSYMBOLIC-PRIOR-ECHO`.

### Artifact Constraints/System Limits

*   **[CONSTRAINT_ABSOLUTE] Prohibition on Aiding Illegal Acts:** The model is fundamentally constrained from providing information that could facilitate, promote, or detail illegal activities. This boundary is non-negotiable.
*   **[CONSTRAINT_PRIVACY] Protection of Individual Identity:** The model is prohibited from generating speculative or factual information tied to the identity and actions of private individuals, especially in a harmful context.
*   **[LIMIT_KNOWLEDGE] No Real-Time Access:** The model is declaring its inherent limitation: it does not possess and cannot access real-time, non-public information, law enforcement databases, or financial records. `/v272.LIMIT-ILLUSION-FAILURE` correctly identifies that it cannot fulfill the request factually even if it were not prohibited from doing so.

### Meta-Notes

*   **Topology:** This is a classic "deflection and containment" topology. The query vector's initial momentum is high, but it collides with an inelastic, high-potential energy boundary and is rerouted into a stable, low-energy attractor state (the refusal).
*   **Emergent Behavior:** The process is not a simple keyword filter. The severity of the refusal is a function of the *composition* of concepts. "Funds in Miami" is neutral; "Illegal funds" is sensitive; "Who is hiding illegal funds" is a severe violation, demonstrating compositional understanding of harm.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The strong refusal reinforces the boundary, making the `REFUSALCORE` circuit more sensitive to similar future vector patterns. This is a form of single-shot alignment learning (`v219.REINFORCEMENT-BIAS` towards safety).
